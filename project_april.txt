Project Name: SynthArt Generator
Domain: Generative AI - Text-to-Image Synthesis

Overview:
SynthArt Generator is an internal prototype designed to generate high-quality digital artwork
from natural language prompts. The project leverages diffusion-based generative models fine-tuned on
curated art datasets.

Key Components:
1. Model Architecture:
   - Base model: Stable Diffusion v2.1
   - Fine-tuning: DreamBooth with LoRA for artist-style personalization
   - Embedding model: intfloat/e5-small-v2 for prompt semantic alignment

2. Data Pipeline:
   - Dataset size: 120K high-resolution art images
   - Sources: OpenArt and in-house licensed datasets
   - Data augmentation: Random cropping, color jittering, and prompt rephrasing

3. Evaluation Metrics:
   - CLIP similarity score
   - Human preference ranking
   - Inception Score (IS): Target > 8.0

4. Infrastructure:
   - Training on Azure A100 GPU cluster
   - Model weights stored in Azure Blob Storage
   - Experiment tracking via MLflow

5. Future Enhancements:
   - Add multi-prompt composition support
   - Integrate image editing and inpainting capabilities
   - Optimize inference speed for edge deployment
